  title: Does Chain of Thought cause models to converge more?
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'The use of Chain of Thought in large language models causes more or
    less convergence in model representations and persona compared to models without
    Chain of Thought.

    '
  background:
    description: 'LLMs and many generative models appear to be converging in representations
      and persona. This idea explores whether Chain of Thought causes more or less
      convergence.
